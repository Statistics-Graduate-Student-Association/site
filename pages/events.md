## Weekly events

### Friday Wind-Down

On Friday evenings, the grad students celebrate the arrival of the weekend by eating, drinking
or doing some activity near Berkeley at the Friday Wind-Down. The studnets are generally
summoned to the wind-down (or "wine-down" if said quickly) by the cry of a comical email,
occasionally including photo-shopped pictures of former Berkeley professors, such as Jerzy
Neyman. See [](/pages/winddowns.md) for more details.

### Tuesday Cookie Hour

Each Tuesday afternoon, members of the department gather for an hour of cookies and pleasant
conversation. Some call this gathering "Cookie Hour". Sometimes, students choose to eat fruit.
They are accepted nonetheless.

## Semesterly events

### Foosball Tournament

Once a semester, we host a foosball tournament, where the winner is awarded eternal glory and
some chocolate or flowers. See [](/pages/foosball.md) for more details.

## Yearly events

There are two major department-wide socializing events with food, drinks and chance to catch
up: the Spring Picnic and the Fall Party.

### The Fall Party

The Fall Party is typically held some time in November.

### The Spring Picnic

The Spring Picnic usually takes place in April. We usually eat, and play frisbee or soccer.
Sometimes we go on a hike after the picnic.

### Berkeley-Stanford Colloquium

### Berkeley-Davis Colloquium
