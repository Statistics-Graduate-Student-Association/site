## Probability Seminar

When: Wednesdays, 3-4pm
Where: 1011 Evans Hall

The probability seminar is a weekly seminar co-sponsored by the Statistics and Mathematics departments featuring the latest research in pure and applied probability, as well as probabilistic work from related disciplines including computer science and operations research. The speakers are typically researchers from other universities, invited to speak at Berkeley. It also offers graduate students a friendly environment to present their research.
